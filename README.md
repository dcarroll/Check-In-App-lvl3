Level 3: Check-In App
=================

This app for Salesforce1 Developer Week is a check-in application that demonstrates both getting directions to a given account record and then the ability to check-in to that location based off of the geolocation from which you are accessing the app.

Code exported from the demo org with [the Force.com CLI](https://github.com/heroku/force). Import the metadata with `force import`:

    $ force import
